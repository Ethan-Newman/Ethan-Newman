Hi all!
	My name is Ethan Newman, and I am currently a senior Computer Science Major at Tennessee Technological University.
	This GitHub is mainly for me to showcase my projects, on-going and otherwise, to the world!
	The purpose is for me to learn different methods of coding and applying what I've learned in class to real-world scenarios.
	As a few professors and industry experts have advised, the best way to learn how to code is to just do it!
	So, that's the purpose of this Repository.
	A little bit about me, I grew up playing classic Nintendo and Sony games, graduating highschool in Covington TN.
	I was initially a Chemical Engineering major before I realized my true passion of all things computing!
	I am going to be a Husband in June of 2021.
	I occassionally pull out a bass guitar and play.

	Thanks for reading!
Ethan Newman
